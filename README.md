# CoalRock-HydraulicFracture-PhaseField-Model
The numerical simulation code used in this study for analyzing the phase-field simulation and crack propagation mechanism of coal-rock hydraulic fracturing under complex stress states has been released as open-source.
# Code Package Introduction
This code package includes 1 multiphysics simulation model built based on COMSOL Multiphysics Version 6.3:

The COMSOL model integrates the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and the triple shear energy criterion to describe the compression-shear mixed fracture behavior, and constructs a dual-phase-field numerical model considering the compression-shear coupling effect and coal-rock interface effect.
The model has been validated by uniaxial compression tests of coal-rock assemblies with prefabricated cracks, and can systematically explore the influence of in-situ stress difference, injection hole water pressure, interface strength ratio, and the coupling effect of coal-rock strength ratio and interface strength ratio on crack propagation.
